 <br> This is a simple cocktail that my girlfriend loves. This drink plays with those apple notes in the Apple Crown Royal and pairs it Cranberry flavors for both sweetness and that beautiful pink color.<br>
 <br>A few things I suggest grabbing that'll pay dividends: I have a basic cocktail making kit that my girlfriend got me for Walmart. It's less than twenty bucks and makes life a lot easier, so I highly reccomend it.. Plus you can pretend to be the cute bartender to her lonely drinker. Agave is awesome for sweetening up alcoholic drinks to taste if you don't feel up to making your own simple syrup. And lastly, what drink is finished without ice?<br>

 <h3>Ingridients</h3>
 <ul>
<li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
<li>5 lbs. red potatoes, peeled and cut into even-sized pieces</li> 
<li>5 cloves garlic, minced or pressed</li> 
<li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
<li>4 oz cream cheese/li>
<li> 1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
<li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Boil the Potatoes in Chicken Broth: Start by bringing 6 cups of chicken broth to a boil. This is a secret tip to enhance the flavor of your potatoes while preventing them from turning brown due to oxidation. Add your red potato pieces to the boiling broth and cook them until they are fork-tender, usually around 15-20 minutes..</li>
    <li>Mash and Add Flavor: Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them and return them to the pot. Use a potato masher or a garlic press to create a smooth, lump-free consistency. The next step is to incorporate the minced or pressed garlic for a delicious flavor punch.</li>
    <li>Creamy Goodness: Cut your unsalted butter into smaller pieces and add them to the potato mixture. Continue to mix until the butter is completely melted, creating a rich and creamy base. Then, introduce the cream cheese to the mixture, ensuring that it’s well combined and further enhancing the velvety texture of the potatoes.</li>
    <li>Perfecting the Texture: Now it’s time to add buttermilk in small increments, adjusting as needed until you reach the desired creamy consistency.</li>
    <li>Season to Taste: To elevate the taste even more, season your mashed potatoes with salt and pepper. Start with a pinch or two and adjust according to your personal preference.</li>
    <li>Serve!</li>
